abstract = {Real-time unusual event detection in video stream has been a difficult challenge due to the lack of sufficient training information, volatility of the definitions for both normality and abnormality, time constraints, and statistical limitation of the fitness of any parametric models. We propose a fully unsupervised dynamic sparse coding approach for detecting unusual events in videos based on online sparse re-constructibility of query signals from an atomically learned event dictionary, which forms a sparse coding bases. Based on an intuition that usual events in a video are more likely to be reconstructible from an event dictionary, whereas unusual events are not, our algorithm employs a principled convex optimization formulation that allows both a sparse reconstruction code, and an online dictionary to be jointly inferred and updated. Our algorithm is completely un-supervised, making no prior assumptions of what unusual events may look like and the settings of the cameras. The fact that the bases dictionary is updated in an online fashion as the algorithm observes more data, avoids any issues with concept drift. Experimental results on hours of real world surveillance video and several Youtube videos show that the proposed algorithm could reliably locate the unusual events in the video sequence, outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.},

@article{Zubair2013,
abstract = {Audio classification is an important problem in signal processing and pattern recognition with potential applications in audio retrieval, documentation and scene analysis. Common to general signal classification systems, it involves both training and classification (or testing) stages. The performance of an audio classification system, such as its complexity and classification accuracy, depends highly on the choice of the signal features and the classifiers. Several features have been widely exploited in existing methods, such as the mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs), line spectral frequencies (LSF) and short time energy (STM). In this paper, instead of using these well-established features, we explore the potential of sparse features, derived from the dictionary of signal atoms using sparse coding based on e.g. orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), where the atoms are adapted directly from audio training data using the K-SVD dictionary learning algorithm. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose to perform pooling and sampling operations on the sparse coefficients. Such operations also help to maintain a unified dimension of the signal features, regardless of the various lengths of the training and testing signals. Using the popular support vector machine (SVM) as the classifier, we examine the performance of the proposed classification system for two binary classification problems, namely speech–music classification and male–female speech discrimination and a multi-class problem, speaker identification. The experimental results show that the sparse (max-pooled and average-pooled) coefficients perform better than the classical MFCCs features, in particular, for noisy audio data.},

abstract = {Sparse coding—that is, modelling data vectors as sparse linear combinations of basis elements—is widely used in machine learning, neuroscience, signal processing, and statistics. This paper focuses on learning the basis set, also called dictionary, to adapt it to specific data, an approach that has recently proven to be very effective for signal reconstruction and classification in the audio and image processing domains. This paper proposes a new online optimization algorithm for dictionary learning, based on stochastic approximations, which scales up gracefully to large datasets with millions of training samples. A proof of convergence is presented, along with experiments with natural images demonstrating that it leads to faster performance and better dictionaries than classical batch algorithms for both small and large datasets.},
